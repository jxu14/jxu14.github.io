<h2 class="title"> STEAK</h2></div>
<div class="description">
<p>Steak is one of my favorite foods. I liked it cook medium rare, since it maintains most of the juice and it's soft. Outback steakhouse makes great steak, and the seasoning is very important.</p>

<div id="secondfood" class="pic"><h2 class="title"> DONUTS</h2></div>
<div class="description">
<p>Donuts are my favorite sugary food. I like them in all flavors, chocolate, glazed, sugar, you name it. You can eat them at any time during the day and as dessert. They're just amazing.</p>
</div>
<div id="thirdfood" class="pic"><h2 class="title"> Baby Back Ribs</h2></div>
<div class="description">
  <p>Baby back ribs are super messy but super good. Armadillo Willys makes great ribs since they slow cook them for 8 hours. Every time I eat them, I eat more than a full slab and I get very messy hands and face.</p>
